## Projects  üë∑‚Äç
- [AMATSA](https://github.com/VSangarya/AMATSA) - Asset Monitoring and Analytics Tool for sysadmins (we call it AMATSA) is a client-based solution for system administrators to monitor assets in their organization. amatsa-client is cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS), can be installed on a server/user PC and takes less than 50MB of disk space at runtime. Once you install the amatsa-client on a host, it will periodically send system metrics (asset info, cpu/memory utilization, network etc.) to the backend server. The backend server runs on Elasticsearch and can be hosted on-premise or in the cloud. Sysadmins can then import our pre-built Kibana dashboard or build custom visualization on top of raw data sent by the clients. The meta data on fields listed here can be used to create custom visualization dashboards. 

- [PackTravel](https://github.com/VSangarya/PackTravel) - PackTravel is a web-application that connects people who want to carpool, share a cab or ride a bus together. Users can offer rides with their own vehicles, or travel together as a group in a cab or a bus. PackTravel helps you stay on a budget by reducing your travel expenses so that you don't have to miss out on that concert you've been wanting to attend.

- [Honest Grade](https://github.com/Rish-P/Teacher-Portal-Honest-Grade) - Honest Grade is a comprehensive test environment which aims to provide service in the form of a complete application with proctoring and test prescribing capabilities. This application contains several modules comprising proctoring, adaptive testing, and subjective answer checking.
